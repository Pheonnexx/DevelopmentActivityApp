=== Current State

This project is kept archived as an example of my first Rails app.

TRILL as seen here was a prototype that I used to start learning to code in Ruby in the Rails framework.  It was presented to my work as something that could be built to help record the training and skills of people in the workplace.  It was taken in and developed in python, but unfortunately I was on another project.

I like keeping my old work around, it serves as good reminder of my developing skills and how I have moved forward.
